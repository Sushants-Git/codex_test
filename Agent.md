# Agent Instructions

Check `TODO.md` for the current implementation backlog. Update it after every significant change so the team can track progress and keep priorities in sync. After committing your changes locally (no pushes), add a note to the TODO item you touched so the history and checklist move forward together. Review runtime output with `cat ~/logs.log` after each change to confirm the dev server is happy.
